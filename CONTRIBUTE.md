To contribute to Jobease, you need to have a basic understanding of Git and GitHub. This guide will help you set up your local environment and contribute effectively.

## Cloning the Repository
To get started, you'll first need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or Git Bash and run the following command:

bash
```
git clone https://github.com/Diya453/Jobease.git
```
This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

## Creating a Branch
Before making any changes, create a new branch to work on. It’s a good practice to name your branch descriptively. Use the following commands:

bash
```
cd Jobease               # Navigate into the project directory
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
Replace your-feature-name with a descriptive name for your branch.

## Making Changes
Now you can make the necessary changes to the code. Use your favorite code editor to edit files, add features, or fix bugs.

## Committing Changes
Once you are satisfied with your changes, it's time to commit them. Use the following commands:

bash
```
git add .                # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Add a short description of your changes"
```
Make sure to write a meaningful commit message that describes your changes clearly.

## Pushing Changes
After committing your changes, push your branch to the remote repository:

bash
```
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
Submitting a Pull Request
Once your changes are pushed, go to your repository on GitHub. You’ll see a prompt to create a pull request for your newly pushed branch. Click on it and provide a detailed description of your changes.

Make sure to review the existing open issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates.

## Code of Conduct
We ask that all contributors adhere to our Code of Conduct to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.

Thank you for considering contributing to Jobease! We look forward to your input and collaboration. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.
